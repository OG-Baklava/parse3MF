# parse3mf

> Drop-in 3MF file parser, multicolor 3D model viewer, and color-safe exporter for React and Node.js.

parse3mf is an npm library for parsing, viewing, and exporting 3MF files — the modern standard for 3D printing. It provides slicer-accurate multicolor detection for Bambu Studio, PrusaSlicer, and Cura files, a React-based 3D viewer with color picker and plate selector, and a production-safe exporter that modifies only color values while preserving all geometry and print settings.

## Key capabilities

- Parse 3MF files and extract geometry, materials, colors, plates, and volume
- Render multicolor 3D models in the browser with Three.js
- Detect multi-material data from Bambu Studio, PrusaSlicer, Cura, and standard 3MF
- Export modified 3MF files with only color values changed (surgical string replacement)
- React components: ThreeMFWorkbench, Viewer, ColorPicker, PlateSelector, SaveButton
- Headless mode: parse3MF() and export3MF() work without React in Node.js or web workers
- Themeable UI with inline styles (no CSS imports needed)

## Install

npm install parse3mf three jszip

## Quick usage

React (all-in-one):
  import { ThreeMFWorkbench } from 'parse3mf'
  <ThreeMFWorkbench file={file} showSaveButton />

Headless (no React):
  import { parse3MF, export3MF } from 'parse3mf/core'
  const result = await parse3MF(file)
  const blob = await export3MF({ originalFile: file, materialSlots: updatedSlots })
